# The Cothority Network Library - ONet

The Overlay-network (ONet) is a library for simulation and deployment of
decentralized, distributed protocols. It offers an abstraction for tree-based
communications between thousands of nodes and is used both in research for 
testing out new protocols and running simulations, as well as in production to
deploy those protocols as a service in a distributed manner.

ONet is developed by [DEDIS/EFPL](http://dedis.epfl.ch) as part of the
[Cothority](https://github.com/dedis/cothority) project that aims to deploy
a large number of conodes for distributed signing and related projects.

## Documentation

- To run and use a conode, have a look at 
	[Cothority Node](https://github.com/dedis/cothority/wiki/Conode)
	with examples of protocols, services and apps
- To start a new project by developing and integrating a new protocol, have a look at
	the [Cothority Template](https://github.com/dedis/cothority_template/wiki)
- To participate as a core-developer, go to 
	[Cothority Network Library](https://github.com/dedis/onet/wiki)
	
## Version

We have a development and a stable version. The `master`-branch in
`github.com/dedis/onet` is the development version that works but can have
incompatible changes.
