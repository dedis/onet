Making Contributions

Onet is an open source project with many contributors (listed in the AUTHORS
files), so we actively seek contributions (documentation, source code, ideas, â€¦).
All contributions help us make a better product.

All contributions without an explicit copyright statement or a CLAI/CLAC (see below)
are assumed to be covered under a AGPL 3-Clause license as described in the
file LICENSE.

Developers who have contributed significant changes to the Onet-code must sign
a Contributor License Agreement (CLAI), eventually also a CLAC if they work for
a corporation. Together they guarantee them the right to use the code they have
developed, and also ensure that EPFL/DEDIS (and thus the Onet project) has the
rights to the code.
By signing the CLAI/CLAC, your contributions are eligible to be integrated into the
Onet source code.
Having the CLAI/CLAC signed is essential for the Onet project to maintain a
clean copyright and guarantees that Onet and your source code will always remain
Free Software (Open Source).
Providing that your contribution is accepted by the Onet project, your signed
CLAI/CLAC also permits EPFL/DEDIS to submit your contribution for use in other
EPFL/DEDIS-projects.

The Contributor License Agreements are in the CLAI and CLAC-file.
